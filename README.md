This is my Internship Task which I have been assigned by The Sparks Foundation, #GRIPOCTOBER22



1-Login Page: This is the initial page where users can enter their credentials to access their banking accounts. It typically includes input fields for username and password, along with a login button.

2-Dashboard: After successful login, the dashboard page provides an overview of the user's accounts and account balances. It can display account cards or a table showing the account names, balances, and other relevant information.

3-Account Details Page: Clicking on an account card or a specific account in the dashboard takes the user to the account details page. This page shows detailed information about a specific account, such as transaction history, available balance, and account-specific options like transferring funds or making payments.

4-Transaction History: The transaction history page displays a list of recent transactions for a selected account. Each transaction entry can include details like date, description, amount, and transaction type (debit/credit).

5-Transfer Funds: This page allows users to transfer funds between their accounts or to other external accounts. It typically includes input fields for selecting the source and destination accounts, along with an amount field and a transfer button.

6-Payment: The payment page enables users to make payments to other individuals or organizations. It can include input fields for the recipient's name, account number, payment amount, and a payment button.
